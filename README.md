# Security-Audit-and-Risk-Asessment
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Botium Toys is a small U.S.-based company that develops and sells toys. While the business operates from a single physical location, its online presence has expanded significantly, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. This growth has placed increasing demands on their IT department to support their global online market.</p>

<p>The IT department manager has recognized the need for an internal IT audit. She is concerned about the lack of a comprehensive plan to ensure business continuity and compliance as the company expands. She believes that an internal audit could enhance the security of the company’s infrastructure and help identify and address potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. Additionally, the manager is focused on ensuring compliance with regulations related to online payments and conducting business within the European Union (E.U.).</p>
 
<p>The IT manager begins by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), defining the audit's scope and objectives, and conducting a risk assessment. The primary goal of the audit is to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential risks the company might face due to its current security posture. The IT manager intends to use the audit findings as justification to secure approval for expanding his department.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Review the IT manager’s defined scope, objectives, and risk assessment. Following this, you will conduct an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<b>Step 1 <br>Listing the audit goals, scope, and risk assessment:</b>
<p>
  <b>Scope:</b><br>

- Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point
detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event
management (SIEM) tool. <br>
- Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point
detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) tool. <br>
- Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting,
end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information
and Event Management (SIEM) tool.<br>
- Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place
align with necessary compliance requirements.<br>
- Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Goals:</b><br>
The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:<br>
- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF) <br>
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant <br>
- Fortify system controls <br>
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential
management <br>
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks <br>
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements <br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Risk assessment</b><br>
  <u><i>Current assets</i></u><br>
Assets managed by the IT Department include:<br>
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs <br>
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones),
remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations,
surveillance cameras, etc. <br>
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting,
telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory
management <br>
- Internet access <br>
- Internal network <br>
- Vendor access management <br>
- Data center hosting services <br>
- Data retention and storage <br>
- Badge readers <br>
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human
monitoring <br>

<p>
<u><i>Risk description</i></u><br>
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does
not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and
international regulations and standards.
</p>

<p>
<u><i>Control best practices</i></u><br>
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to
dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the
impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.
</p>

<p>
<u><i>Risk score</i></u><br>
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of
controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.
</p>

<p>
<u><i>Additional comments</i></u><br>
The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the
necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related to keeping customer data private.
</p>
